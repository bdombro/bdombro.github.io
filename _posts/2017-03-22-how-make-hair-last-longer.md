Much like you can’t choose whether or not you’re blessed with a Jon Hamm jawline, you can’t decide the fate of your hair, either. Hair loss and the rate at which it takes hold is – although partly influenced by factors such as diet and lifestyle – primarily determined by the genetic cards dealt in the first place.

“The major hair loss problem suffered by men – over 50 per cent by the age of 50 – is androgenetic alopecia, or male pattern hair loss. This occurs when genetically predisposed hair follicles become gradually sensitive to [the testosterone by-product dihydrotestosterone, or DHT],” says Glenn Lyons, a trichologist at Philip Kingsley.

“The affected follicles produce increasingly finer and shorter hairs until growth ceases altogether. [Age is the main determiner of] the rate at which men bald; experiencing hair loss in late teens or twenties means the gene is more dominant.”

That doesn’t mean you should take hair loss lying down. Whether you’re 21 or 51, there are several ways to stem the tide – even if DNA is conspiring to see your healthy crop taken before its time.
