But with a steady slew of launches each month, and others adding to our burgeoning collections at Christmas and on birthdays, they have a tendency to pile up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a clear out of a clogged-up grooming kit is a chance to rethink what is really needed and, if nothing else, make room for a few new buys. Here, with the help of industry experts, we’ve put together the blueprint for a clutter-free cabinet to match your daily needs. Now, freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benevolent Tech</name><email>brian@benevolent.tech</email></author><summary type="html">Naturally, we men can become quite fond of grooming products (especially when they get the job – whether that’s alleviating bags after a heavy night or covering the odd spot – done, and done well).

Hair loss and the rate at which it takes hold is – although partly influenced by factors such as diet and lifestyle – primarily determined by the genetic cards dealt in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The major hair loss problem suffered by men – over 50 per cent by the age of 50 – is androgenetic alopecia, or male pattern hair loss. This occurs when genetically predisposed hair follicles become gradually sensitive to [the testosterone by-product dihydrotestosterone, or DHT],” says Glenn Lyons, a trichologist at Philip Kingsley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The affected follicles produce increasingly finer and shorter hairs until growth ceases altogether. [Age is the main determiner of] the rate at which men bald; experiencing hair loss in late teens or twenties means the gene is more dominant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you should take hair loss lying down. Whether you’re 21 or 51, there are several ways to stem the tide – even if DNA is conspiring to see your healthy crop taken before its time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benevolent Tech</name><email>brian@benevolent.tech</email></author><summary type="html">Much like you can’t choose whether or not you’re blessed with a Jon Hamm jawline, you can’t decide the fate of your hair, either.

&lt;p&gt;What’s not so great about ageing though is how everything, physiologically speaking – from your brows to your balls – takes a violent nosedive. Luckily, there are ways to take the edge off the ageing process. From what to have for dinner to how to style your hair, here’s our guide to getting better-looking as you age.

&lt;p&gt;The therapist at London’s premier grooming location Gentleman’s Tonic frequently has the job of getting man’s ugliest appendage in order for summer. We’re talking about his boney, hairy, callus-ridden feet, which after six months hidden away from the world are probably not fit for public display.&lt;/p&gt;
